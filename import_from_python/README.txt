This example shows how to call Python code from the C++-side.
This requires you to embed the Python interpreter into your C++ program.

There is a base class named Card, implemented in C++. 
There is a derived class named Fire_Spirit, implemented in Python.

The function callme() instantiates a Fire_Spirit class, and prints the attributes name and text.

To execute:
$ python execute.py
